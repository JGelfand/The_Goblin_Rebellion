  description= _ "Some especially small and lightly armed goblins are capable of slipping between enemies in search of injured opponents to finish off. Called 'Stabbers' by friend and foe alike, these combatants are viciously single-minded in their pursuit of injured enemies- a trait that often works to their detriment due to being lightly armored.

  This unit's skirmish ability lets it ignore enemy zones of control.
  This unit has no zone of control."
